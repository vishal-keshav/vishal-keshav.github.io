<pre><code>Problem solved: With each convolution layer, reduce
the computation of convolution that results in zero
activation.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Hints about zero features that may lead to zero activation
is given by a parallel light-weight convolution (either spatial or depth wise) activation.</li>
<li>LCCL (low cost collaborative layer) are parallel low cost convolutions providing zero outcome hints to main convolution.</li>
<li>To increase the sparsity, methods such as using RelU activation and Batch Normalization is explored.</li>
<li>Mentions of GEMM and GEMV for theoretical and practical acceleration improvements.</li>

<h3 id="learning-efficient-convolutional-networks-through-network-slimming">Learning Efficient Convolutional Networks through Network Slimming</h3>
<pre><code>Problem solved: Reducing the input channels that have near
zero activation, by enforcing L1 norm to be zero along with regularization
effect. Lesser the input channels, faster the inference.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Input channel are pruned during the training by enforcing L1 norm to become zero.</li>
<li>L1 regularization on scaling factor of batch normalization layers per channel does not require any architectural changes.</li>
<li>Zero L1 enforcement per channel is achieved by addition of L1 norm of batch in the total cost function which then is needed to be minimized.</li>
<li>Drop in the prediction accuracy can be restored by retraining with multi-pass scheme.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pruning-filters-for-efficient-convnets">Pruning Filters For Efficient Convnets</h3>
<pre><code>Problem solved: Reduction in number of filters with low L1 norm.
These filters are assumed to have insignificant contribution to
output channels. With reduced filters, both complexity of computation
of convolution at current layer and next layer decreases.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Filters in a given layer of a trained model are compared against each other based on L1 norm, and removed proportionally.</li>
<li>Removal of filters is done in a single shot for whole network, after which training can be done to restore the accuracy</li>
<li>Pruning filters across multiple layer can be done in either independent or greedy way.</li>
<li>Sensitivity of pruning filters in a given layer is measured by the rate at which accuracy decreases with respect to number of pruned filter. Highly sensitive layers are left out for pruning.</li>

<h3 id="data-driven-sparse-structure-selection-for-deep-neural-networks">Data-Driven Sparse Structure Selection for Deep Neural Networks</h3>
<pre><code>Problem solved: A systematic approach to prune structures is a
deep network including filters or neurons, resnet blocks and grouped
convolution (cardinality) is presented. Additional parameters
in cost function is enforced to zero in order to realize structure
pruning.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>A general end-to-end framework for pruning structures at once without the need for retraining.</li>
<li>Scaling factors is not needed to be necessarily associated to network weights (so does the gradients), these are generalized parameters and gradients are computed in additions to weight gradients</li>
<li>Accelerated Proximal Gradient is adopted for scaling factor training</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pruning-convolutional-neural-networks-for-resource-efficient-inference">Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks For Resource Efficient Inference</h3>
<pre><code>Problem solved: Evaluates/proposes the greedy criterion for pruning
feature maps with an objective of minimizing the cost difference
before and after pruning along with L1 norm constraints on pruned
weights. With FLOPs criteria, it achieves resource efficient inference.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>It formalizes the gated pruning (i.e. if this feature channel be pruned or not) based on greedy criteria such as minimized weight, mean, deviation of activation, information gain, first order taylor expansion etc.</li>
<li>System has two steps, pruning in which based on criteria, the importance of neurons is evaluated and pruned</li>
<li>Training in which it trains the network with constrained cost object in consideration.</li>

<h3 id="condensenet-an-efficient-densenet-using-learned-group-convolutions">CondenseNet: An Efficient DenseNet using Learned Group Convolutions</h3>
<pre><code>Problem solved: Improves the dense-net by introducing the concept
of learned group convolution. Condensing and optimization
(both being the part of training phase) helps prune filters per
logical groups which gets re-arranged by indexing to formulate
normal group convolution. Better design strategy for dense-net
is also proposed.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Exponential growth rate of input channel is compensated by using depth wise separable convolution in case of dense net. Condense net improvises this by group convolution that learns the grouping.</li>
<li>Method used allows groups to automatically select appropriate channels or not use some at all. Since this architecture follows dense-net, non-used channels will be useful in another layer.</li>
<li>Condense stage involves pruning per group by sparsity regularizer and optimization stage (second half of training stage) involves re-arranging and indexing of input filters for group convolution.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="delugenets-deep-networks-with-efficient-and-flexible-cross-layer-information-inflows">DelugeNets: Deep Networks with Efficient and Flexible Cross-layer Information Inflows</h3>
<pre><code>Problem solved: Effectively propagating cross layers parameters
as compared to residual blocks but at the same time being more
efficient that dense-nets. Through cross-layer depthwise convolution
the efficient information flow is possible whilst providing more
flexibility than resnets.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Per block, composite network is used (bottle neck design) having same map dimentions.</li>
<li>In one block, inputs from each preceding layers are convolved by point wise convolution channel wise. In other words, for a given channel c, all the filter maps at channel c from preceding layers are segregated and convolved depthwise to get filter map of channel c in the input layer. Same process to all channels.</li>
<li>For block transition (where dimention changes), 3X3 strided filters are applied to match the input dimentions.</li>
<li>Whole idea is to have cross layer separable convolution to reduce computation complexity.</li>

<h3 id="deep-pyramidal-residual-networks">Deep Pyramidal Residual Networks</h3>
<pre><code>Problem solved: Through empirical studies, it was found that
increase in feature map dimention at residual blocks significantly
increase the resnet burden at those layers. Thus, a gradual increase
in feature map depth is introduced which increase accuracy.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Pyramidal shape is introduced which gradually increase the filters at every layer. Skip connections are done through zero padding instead of 1X1 convolution.</li>
<li>Several pyramidal designs are explored which increase the filters as a function of layer index.</li>
