      <description>ML101 These paper appeared in several renowned conferences around the world with an impact of making inference faster in deep learning terminology. Ideas from these paper have been extracted and presented in a simplified manner.  Papers yet to be published Papers from 2017 More is Less: A More Complicated Network with Less Inference Complexity Problem solved: With each convolution layer, reduce the computation of convolution that results in zero activation.</description>
